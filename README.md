# AEROFRAME

A stablecoin-powered e-commerce storefront with cross-chain USDC checkout. Customers pay with USDC from any supported EVM chain to a single address; the merchant sees one unified balance and withdraws to whichever chain they want. Built with Next.js 14 and Circle Unified Balance (App Kit + CCTP).

## How It Works

```
Customer clicks "Pay with USDC"
        │
        ▼
Modal collects name, email, delivery address
        │
        ▼
Backend creates order + generates a unique deposit address (one EVM address, all chains)
        │
        ▼
Checkout page shows QR + address, polls for payment status every 3s
        │
        ▼
Customer sends USDC from ANY supported chain (Arc, Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, OP, Unichain)
        │
        ▼
Multi-chain listener detects the payment, identifies the source chain
        │
        ▼
Arc payments  → stay native (no CCTP needed; USDC is already on Circle's L1)
Other chains  → auto-deposit into Unified Balance via CCTP
        │
        ▼
Order marked PAID, customer sees receipt with tx hash
        │
        ▼
Merchant dashboard shows unified balance across all chains
Merchant withdraws to any of 8 chains (direct transfer if funds are still native, UB spend otherwise)
```

## Features

- **Single-Address Cross-Chain Checkout** — one EVM address accepts USDC from 7 chains
- **Multi-Chain Payment Listener** — polls all supported chains every 10s for incoming USDC
- **Hybrid Settlement** — Arc payments stay native (instant); non-Arc payments auto-deposit to Unified Balance via CCTP
- **Unified Balance Dashboard** — merchant sees one total balance across all chains, with per-chain breakdown
- **Cross-Chain Withdrawals** — withdraw to any of 8 chains. Smart routing: direct transfer when funds are still in the deposit wallet, UB spend when funds are already in Unified Balance.
- **QR Code Checkout** — scan-to-pay with real-time payment detection
- **Merchant Authentication** — password-gated dashboard
- **Live Order Feed** — auto-refreshing orders table with status, chain, and revenue tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A merchant wallet address (any EVM address you control)
- A gas wallet with small ETH balances on each supported testnet (for funding deposit-wallet gas)
- Circle App Kit access (handled via the SDK)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adeyemir/Aeroframe.git
cd Aeroframe
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:

```env
# Merchant — where unified balance is withdrawn to
MERCHANT_ADDRESS=0xYourMerchantWalletAddress

# Gas wallet — funds deposit wallets so they can sign deposit() / transfer() txs
GAS_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYourGasWalletPrivateKey

# Admin password for the dashboard
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_password

# RPC endpoints (defaults shown — override if you have private RPCs)
RPC_ARC_TESTNET=https://rpc.testnet.arc.network
RPC_ETH_SEPOLIA=https://ethereum-sepolia.publicnode.com
RPC_BASE_SEPOLIA=https://base-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com
RPC_ARB_SEPOLIA=https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc
RPC_AVAX_FUJI=https://api.avax-test.network/ext/bc/C/rpc
RPC_OP_SEPOLIA=https://sepolia.optimism.io
RPC_UNICHAIN_SEPOLIA=https://sepolia.unichain.org

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### 3. Run the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The multi-chain listener starts automatically and watches all configured chains every 10 seconds.

### 4. Test a payment

1. Go to the storefront and click **Pay with USDC** on any product
2. Fill in your details and click **Proceed to Payment**
3. Send testnet USDC to the displayed deposit address from any of the supported chains
4. Watch the checkout page auto-update when payment is confirmed
5. View it on the **Merchant Dashboard** at `/dashboard`
6. Withdraw the unified balance to any chain from the dashboard

### 5. Get testnet USDC

| Chain | Faucet |
|-------|--------|
| Arc Testnet | https://faucet.arc.network |
| Ethereum Sepolia | https://faucet.circle.com |
| Base Sepolia | https://faucet.circle.com |
| Arbitrum Sepolia | https://faucet.circle.com |
| Avalanche Fuji | https://faucet.circle.com |
| OP Sepolia | https://faucet.circle.com |
| Unichain Sepolia | https://faucet.circle.com |

## API Reference

### `POST /api/orders/create`

Creates a new order and generates a unique deposit address.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "customerName": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "deliveryAddress": "Digital delivery",
  "item": "DJI Mini 4 Pro — 3D Model File",
  "amount": 12.00
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "order_xxx",
  "depositAddress": "0x...",
  "amount": 12.00,
  "supportedChains": ["Arc Testnet", "Ethereum Sepolia", ...]
}
```

### `GET /api/orders/status?id=order_xxx`

Returns the current status of an order. Polled by the checkout page every 3 seconds.

### `GET /api/orders`

Returns all orders with aggregate stats and the multi-chain listener status. Used by the merchant dashboard.

### `POST /api/withdraw`

Withdraws all available funds to the merchant address on a target chain. Hybrid strategy:

- **Direct transfer:** if USDC is still sitting in the deposit wallet (e.g. Arc-native payments), do a direct ERC-20 transfer.
- **UB spend:** if USDC has been deposited into Unified Balance via CCTP, call `unifiedBalance.spend()` to mint on the target chain.

**Request body:**
```json
{
  "chain": "Arc_Testnet"
}
```

Supported chains: `Arc_Testnet`, `Base_Sepolia`, `Ethereum_Sepolia`, `Arbitrum_Sepolia`, `Avalanche_Fuji`, `Optimism_Sepolia`, `Unichain_Sepolia`.

## Production Notes

- Replace the in-memory order store (`src/lib/orders.js`) with a database (Postgres, Supabase, etc.)
- Move private keys out of env vars into a KMS (AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, etc.)
- Add per-merchant authentication beyond the single shared password
- Switch RPC endpoints to private/paid providers (Alchemy, Infura, QuickNode) for production reliability
- Run the multi-chain listener as a separate worker process instead of in-server
- Add Sentry / structured logging for the listener and withdraw paths
- Switch USDC contract addresses and chain RPCs to mainnet equivalents

## Why Cross-Chain Matters

Most e-commerce stablecoin checkouts force customers to bridge or hold tokens on a specific chain before they can pay. Aeroframe accepts USDC from wherever the customer already holds it — Arc, Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, or Unichain — to a single address. The merchant sees one balance and withdraws to whichever chain suits their treasury.

This is the actual user experience stablecoins promised: borderless, chain-agnostic value transfer with no bridging friction at checkout.
